My name is Ralph.  I am interested in the philosophy of managing versions. 

We have all had the experience of managing versions of a written document manually.  You make changes cautiously and you save versions so that you can revert to an old state.  If you edit vigorously, you may invent your own system for naming and organizing the branching complex of versions.  If you edit in a group or team of writers, then version management becomes really something to talk about.

Each writer develops her own version of a thing with the intention that her ideas will become a part of the shared thing.

On one hand, this experience is particular to computers and something that no ordinary person had ever experienced before, say the 1980's. 

On the other hand, ideas change in this same way.  Consider a theological idea like G-d or the soul or a scientific idea like a rainbow or planetary motion. 

The idea of an automated system for managing versions of a thing is itself a thing which changes, version by version, through time.

Cvs, mercurial, darcs and now git, the king of them all, may be the greatest contribution of the world of computer programmers to the larger world. 

Github is a new way to be social and also a new answer to the old question, "What is a thing?"
